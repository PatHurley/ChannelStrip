This project was primarily an opportunity to learn plugin development for future products.
With that being the case, I still wanted to create a viable plugin that you would feel confident using in a recording session or on a professional mix.
I also wanted to make it as transparent and low-latency as possible, making it as easy to incorporate into your workflow as possible.
