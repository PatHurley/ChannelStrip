# ChannelStrip
A free, fully-featured, lightweight audio plugin built using the iPlug2 framework.

Planned support for VST3, AAX, & AU formats. (potentially a mobile app where you can mix and record using your phone's mic)

Features:
 - Simple knob and button controls, compatible with manual value input
 - input/output metering and gain adjustment
 - 4-band parametric EQ
 - Alternate filter shapes for each band:
    Bell, HPF, LPF, Lo Shelf, Hi Shelf
 - 2 dynamics processors
 - Alternate dynamics mode for each processor:
    Gate, Expander, Compressor, Limiter
 - 8 selectable discrete ratios for each processor

This project was primarily an opportunity to learn plugin development & DSP coding for future products.
With that being the case, I still wanted to create a viable plugin that you would feel confident using in a recording session or on a professional mix.
I also wanted to make it transparent and low-latency, making it as easy to accept into your workflow as possible.
I may not keep it open-source, but I intend to keep the plugin free (I may monetize the standalone mobile app, as well as sell ads on the distribution website).
